My game is a simple 3 level platform game where you can kill and pick up actions to move onto the next level. There are multiple options that allow you to pause, play, restart, quit, mute, unmute, turn the volume up and  down, saving and loading the game from 3 different file locations and switching from 3 different characters that  have 3 different traits.
